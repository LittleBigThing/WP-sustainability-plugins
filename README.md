# WordPress sustainability plugins

This is a list (in the making) of WordPress plugins that are related to sustainability (in the broader sense of the word).

## Carbon Footprint

This WordPress plugin adds a collection of tests and information to WordPressâ€™ [Site Health](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/) tool. It provides insight into the sustainability of the website by estimating its carbon footprint. The plugin uses the [Website Carbon API](https://api.websitecarbon.com/), kindly provided by [Wholegrain Digital](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/). You can test your site directly (including other pages then the homepage) using the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/).
