# WordPress sustainability plugins

This is a list (in the making) of WordPress plugins that are related to sustainability (in alphabetical order and in the broader sense of the word).

## Carbon Footprint

This WordPress plugin adds a collection of tests and information to WordPress’ [Site Health](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/) tool. It provides insight into the sustainability of the website by estimating its carbon footprint. The plugin uses the [Website Carbon API](https://api.websitecarbon.com/), kindly provided by [Wholegrain Digital](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/). You can test your site directly (including other pages then the homepage) using the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/).

## Carbon Offset

This plugin calculates the greenhouse emissions from your website visits and integrates with the [Cloverly](https://cloverly.com/) for offsets & payments. The plugin is easily extendable to add future implementations of other services capable of carbon offsets on demand, as well as transaction-based carbon-offsetting for e-commerce (not yet implemented in v1.0).

## Crawl Optimization

The Crawl Optimization Plugin is designed to help optimize your website’s crawl rate by removing unnecessary links and information from your HTTP headers. By removing elements such as shortlinks, REST API links, RSD/WLW links, oEmbed links, generator tags, and X-Pingback headers, this plugin streamlines the navigation of your website and reduces the amount of data transferred. Additionally, it also removes the “powered by” HTTP header which reveals the software and plugins used on your website, keeping your site more secure. With the Crawl Optimization Plugin SEO plugin, your website will load faster and be more easily navigated by search engines, improving your overall SEO.

The plugin allows to individually enable and test the modules to get their benefits before they become available in WordPress core, and to provide feedback to further improve the solutions.
